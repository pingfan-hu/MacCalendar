A free and open-source mini menu bar calendar for macOS with Chinese lunar calendar support.

## Features

MiniCalendar lives in your menu bar and integrates with the system Calendar app. Click the icon to see your events, lunar dates, solar terms, and traditional holidays in a clean interface.

Choose which calendars to display in Settings. Toggle the lunar calendar on or off based on your needs. Customize the menu bar display to show an icon, date, time, or custom format.

Event locations with URLs (like Zoom links) open directly in your browser. Navigate months by scrolling on the calendar. Everything adapts to your system language and week start preference.

## Installation

Download the latest DMG from the [Releases page](https://github.com/pingfan-hu/MiniCalendar/releases). Drag MiniCalendar to Applications and launch. The app is signed and notarized by Apple.

Right-click the menu bar icon to access Settings.
